## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lexi Reed and I have been a Business Analyst at  Alter Domus for over two years focusing on developing, testing, and fixing reports using SQL, Python, PowerBi, and Excel in the FinTech industry. I have a Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Applied and Computational Mathematics from DePaul University. 

In my free time, I'm probably learning new data skills, rock climbing, or playing with my cats. Please look around at my pinned repositories to view some of my projectors and browse other repositories that look interesting as well.
